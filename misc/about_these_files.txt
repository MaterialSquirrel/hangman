Two files in this section were used to change .txt files into .py files.
Originally I had called the .txt files from the program, but then when I
compiled a single executable using pyinstaller, the .exe program would not
function if the .txt files were missing. Having only .py files produces
a much cleaner, single executable.

Using 'dictionary_read.py', I converted a 'dictionary.txt' to
'dictionary.json'. I did it this way in order to automate the creation of
a properly syntaxed list. I then pasted that list into a file
called 'dictionary.py'.

Using 'build_hangmans.py', I converted 7 different .txt files to
7 different .json outputs, each containing a string. I did it this
way in order to properly capture all the characters and whitespace.
I then pasted each one together into a dictionary in 'man_art.py'.

I could have left these both in the main hangman.py file, but I left them
separate in an attempt to stay organized.
